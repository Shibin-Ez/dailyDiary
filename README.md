We're planning to make a CENTRALISED MESS MANAGEMENT SYSTEM for students and staff at a college to keep up with our transactions in a way it'll make it easier for staff to manage the mess.

We'll be making it using React for the frontend of Staff and MongoDB as the database, node as the backend, and Flutter for the front-end app interface of students.
